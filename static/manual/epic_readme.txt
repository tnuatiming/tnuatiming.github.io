## raspberry pi ##

using the rpi as local web server, to get results locally and then uploading them to site.

files needed to be modified to the production dir/file names.

make sure the local web server folder (tt) has the latest updates.

master.html and elite_epic.js is on the timing computer, when the page is open in chromium('gc' and 'finish' must be selected) it generate j1.txt json(dont forget to enable). it also generate p3.html for the single day competitors(FIXME - add to python). the python script below sense changes and upload it to the web server. on the web server we have index.html and elite_epic_remote.js that phrase the json and show the results.
for tv, we have tv.html which uses the same elite_epic.js, at least for now.

1. run 'python3 -m http.server' in the local website folder (tt).

2. USE THIS! 'python3 ftp_with_inotify_and_log.py' - this upload j1.txt from /home/pi/Downloads (where chromium saves files) to the web server (check address!)
2a. to upload the p1.html as is use: 'python3 ftp_with_inotify.py' (modify to upload j1.txt) - more updated with log: 'python3 ftp_with_inotify_and_log.py'
2b. to upload the PHRASE p1.html file use: 'python3 ftp_and_phrase_for_rpi.py'
2c. to upload j1.txt after local converting the p1.html use: 'python3 ftp_j1_with_inotify.py'

## rpi settings ##

apple magicpad:
sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-libinput

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf:

Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "touchpad"
    Driver "libinput"
	MatchIsTouchpad "on"
	Option "Tapping" "on"    
EndSection

## serial connection rs-232

Ground              GRD (usually black wire)


## option for getting j1.txt using python

python3 live.py


## option for getting j1.txt using python(very slow for now): ## DO NOT USE, TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND NOT COMPLETE SOLUTION!!!

sudo apt-get install python3-pandas

python3 convert_p1_to_json.py


## Elite ##

make sure live settings are pointing to the rpi web server (10.0.0.77, 22, passive, pi, raspberry, /home/pi/tt/liveepic/, use sftp, temp.html, upgrade every 30 sec).

build classification for epic: 

    (מספר) - Id_Numero
    (שם) - Id_Nom
    (זמן) - Id_TpsCumule
    (הקפות) - Id_NbTour
    (קטגוריה) - Id_Categorie
    (&nbsp;) - Id_Image
    (Nationality) - Id_Nationalite
    (Inter. 1) - Id_Inter1 - intermediate time 1
    (Inter. 2) - Id_Inter2 - intermediate time 2
    (Inter. 3) - Id_Inter3 - intermediate time 3
    (Class) - Id_Classe - mark 1 day competitors ('sf' for Friday and 'ss' for Saturday)
    (Group) - Id_Groupe - add letters as follows: "u" - UCI Rider(convert xls "yes" on UCI colnum to "u" and import into Group), "b" - blue rider, "s" - single Rider, "l" - leader(yellow shirt), "d" - DSQ.
    (Team) - Id_Equipe - team name
    (Channel) - Id_Canal - mark "started" for prologue
    
set race settings > others > cycling:

set time precision to "tenth". MOST IMPORTANT, OTHER WISE TIMING WILL BE WRONG!!!.

after green flag, update flag time, assign to all competitors . alternately, set "assign competitors start time at green flag date time" - need testing.
for prologue, use schedule start.

when importing competitors, make sure to import uci rider as "u" into "Group".

on prologue stage, make sure to have "prologue" in race name as it active the position arrow display (not needed in other stages)

before start of stage, make sure to update "Group" - ("ubsld").
make sure 'MaximumStageTime' set correctly, as it auto finish the day stage.

elite_epic_remote.js - the js to put on the remote server, reads JSON j1.txt. needs to enable in elite_epic.js which run as in between.

riders wont get automatic blue if exceeds 2 minutes separation on intermediate , use status 5 to make the rider blue.


## on epic site ##

our code goes under:  <div class="main_content">
add epic.css to head: <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" type="text/css" href="epic.css">
add id="live" to body tag (maybe not needed)
check if needed #live in the css


## web pages  ##

master management - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/master.html (wiil have csv download on stage end)

TV - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/tv.html (manual refresh?)

TV total - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/tvtotal.html (manual refresh?) to get live total, not implemented yet

live - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/index.html and on epic site

stage - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/stage.html and on epic site, day stage results (same concept as total)

master total - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/mastertotal.html and on epic site (use t1.txt-t4.txt and to update elite_epic_total.js?v=1 after every stage finish, will have csv download on stage end)

totalsingle - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/totalsingle.html on epic site, copy of tables generated by mastertotal.html (use publish button or use quick source viewer extension to get the tables, remove "fadeIn" except table tag), per day.

total - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/total.html on epic site, can view all days. uses publish box(q1.txt) generated by mastertotal.html

single day - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/single.html and on epic site (support added to elite_epic.js as p3.html, remember to enable on master)

prologue start clock - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/start.html (computer time must be sync, start every 30 sec)

kiosk - https://tnuatiming.com/liveepic/kiosk.html iterate over categories and gc every 10 sec, show 14 competitors and auto jump to next intermediate/finsh when 3 competitors got there.



## daily update ##

Id_Groupe

update start time Maximum Stage Time in master (elite_epic_remote.js and elite_epic.js), if possible, update in evning before so count down will be shown on live

elite_epic_total.js?v=1 change version

stages in elite_epic_total.js (auto?)

update t1.txt-t4.txt in ftp_with_inotify_and_log.py (for live total TV)

add t1.txt-t4.txt

"prologue" in race name for day 1

enableJ3 enabled for single day




## after stage finish ##

check on master all intermediate times for missing or blue and update status (status 5 for blue)
check DNF
publish on master to get stage results and cleanResults to get csv
after uploading t1.txt-t4.txt(from j1.txt), publish on mastertotal to get total results and cleanResults to get csv


## testing ##
test.html + testEpic.py will genrate test
